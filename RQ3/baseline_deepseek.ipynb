      "Okay, so I'm trying to set up Grunt Browser Sync on Cloud9, but I'm having some trouble. Let me think through this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that Grunt is a task runner and Browser Sync helps with syncing browser actions across devices. So the goal is to get them working together in my project. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that installing the necessary packages is the first step. So I should run npm install for both grunt and grunt-browser-sync. That makes sense because without these installed, Grunt won't know how to run the Browser Sync task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, initializing a Gruntfile.js is crucial. I think the user might have forgotten this or maybe set it up incorrectly. The Gruntfile needs to load the browser sync plugin using grunt.loadNpmTask(). Without that, Grunt can't execute the task. So I should make sure to include that in my answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, configuring Browser Sync within the Gruntfile is important. They need to specify the server and files sections so Browser Sync knows which files to watch. Maybe the user didn't set this up correctly, leading to issues with file watching or injection.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recall that on Cloud9, you have to use localhost as 0.0.0.0 because it's a remote environment. If they're using 'localhost' without the port, maybe the server isn't accessible properly. So I should mention setting the host to 'localhost' and the port accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running the Grunt task is straightforward with grunt browserSync. But sometimes, permissions can be an issue on Cloud9. Suggesting running the command with sudo might help if they're encountering permission errors. That's a common gotcha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing is that Browser Sync usually injects a script into HTML files for syncing. If their HTML isn't being served correctly or the server isn't set up right, this injection won't happen. They need to make sure their server task is running and their HTML is accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting up a full example Gruntfile could help them see everything in context. Including both the browserSync and watch tasks ensures that files are watched and synced automatically. Maybe they only set up one of these tasks, so providing a complete configuration would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, after setting everything up, if it still doesn't work, I should suggest running the server and Browser Sync manually to see where things break. This way, they can identify if it's an issue with Grunt, the server setup, or something else entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that covers the main points. By guiding them through installing packages, setting up the Gruntfile correctly, handling Cloud9 specifics, and troubleshooting, I can help them resolve their Browser Sync setup issues.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To set up `grunt-browser-sync` in a Cloud9 development environment, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Install Required Packages:**\n",
      "   Install Grunt and the browser sync plugin by running:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   npm install grunt grunt-browser-sync --save-dev\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Initialize Gruntfile.js:**\n",
      "   Create or update your `Gruntfile.js` to include the browser sync configuration:\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   module.exports = function(grunt) {\n",
      "     // Load the plugin\n",
      "     grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browser-sync');\n",
      "\n",
      "     // Configure the browser sync task\n",
      "     grunt.initConfig({\n",
      "       browserSync: {\n",
      "         dev: {\n",
      "           bsFiles: {\n",
      "             src: './'\n",
      "           },\n",
      "           server: {\n",
      "             baseDir: './'\n",
      "           }\n",
      "         }\n",
      "       }\n",
      "     });\n",
      "\n",
      "     // Register tasks\n",
      "     grunt.registerTask('default', ['browserSync']);\n",
      "   };\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run the Task:**\n",
      "   Execute the browser sync task with:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   grunt browserSync\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This will start a server and open your project in the browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Troubleshooting Tips:**\n",
      "   - Ensure you're using `localhost` as the host in Cloud9.\n",
      "   - Verify that port 3000 (or your specified port) is open.\n",
      "   - If permissions are an issue, run with `sudo`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a complete example of a Gruntfile configured with browser sync and watch tasks:\n",
      "\n",
      "```javascript\n",
      "module.exports = function(grunt) {\n",
      "  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-browser-sync');\n",
      "  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\n",
      "\n",
      "  grunt.initConfig({\n",
      "    browserSync: {\n",
      "      dev: {\n",
      "        bsFiles: {\n",
      "          src: ['./']\n",
      "        },\n",

      "        }\n",
      "      }\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    watch: {\n",
      "      files: ['<%= browserSync.dev.bsFiles.src %>'],\n",
      "      tasks: ['browserSyncReload']\n",
      "    }\n",

      "\n",
      "  grunt.registerTask('default', ['browserSync', 'watch']);\n",
      "};\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
